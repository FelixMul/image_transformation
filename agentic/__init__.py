"""Agentic macro placement workflow package.

This package contains the LangGraph-based reimplementation of the
macro placement system. The code is organized around:

- workflow state definitions (`state.py`)
- tool implementations per agent (`tools/`)
- graph node logic (`nodes/`)
- utility helpers (`utils/`)
- streamlit entry point (`app.py`)

See `agentic/README.md` for a detailed overview.
