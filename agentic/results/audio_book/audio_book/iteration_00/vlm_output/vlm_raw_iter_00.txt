### Layout Plan for Vertical Design

Given the guidelines and constraints, here's how we can approach designing a vertical layout:

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Key Objects**: Begin by identifying all key objects such as headers, logos, CTAs, images, and other text blocks from the original data. Ensure each object is used exactly once.

2. **Apply Hard Constraints**:
   - **Nesting Depth**: Ensure no objects are nested within containers. Each container should directly hold its related objects.
   - **No Overlap**: Arrange objects so that none overlap, especially ensuring text does not overlay images.
   - **Canvas Boundaries**: Confirm all objects fit entirely within the canvas boundaries with text fully visible.

3. **Soft Constraints Application**:
   - **Grouping**: Group objects similarly to the original layout where it makes sense. For instance, if the original had a header followed by an image and then a block of text, maintain this sequence vertically.
   - **Reading Order**: Maintain the reading order of text elements as they appeared in the original layout.
   - **Horizontal â†’ Vertical Mapping**: Adjust placements according to the transformation rules. For example, if an element was at the top-right corner in the horizontal layout, place it towards the bottom-left in the vertical layout.

4. **Key Object Placement**:
   - **Header**: Place the main header near the top of the vertical layout.
   - **Logo**: Position the logo either at the very top or bottom depending on the original placement.
   - **CTA**: Place the call-to-action button in the lower half of the layout, ideally around the two-thirds mark but not too close to the bottom edge.

5. **Balance and Centering**:
   - **Even Spacing**: Distribute objects evenly across the canvas to avoid large empty spaces. Aim for proportional margins between objects.
   - **Centeredness**: Center most objects by default, adjusting top and bottom margins proportionally to inter-object spacing. Only deviate from centering if the original design had a specific off-center placement.

6. **Special Placements**: Retain any special placements seen in the original design, such as objects snapped to borders or intentionally offset.

#### Example Layout Plan:

Assuming the original horizontal layout had the following elements:

- **Header**: Top-left corner
- **Logo**: Top-right corner
- **Main Image**: Centered horizontally
- **Text Block 1**: Below the image, aligned left
- **Text Block 2**: Below Text Block 1, aligned right
- **CTA Button**: Bottom-right corner

The vertical layout would look like this:

1. **Header**: Positioned at the top-center of the vertical layout.
2. **Logo**: Positioned just below the header, centered.
3. **Main Image**: Centered below the logo, taking up a significant portion of the middle section.
4. **Text Block 1**: Positioned below the image, slightly left-aligned.
5. **Text Block 2**: Positioned below Text Block 1, slightly right-aligned.
6. **CTA Button**: Positioned in the lower third of the layout, centered but not too close to the bottom edge.

This plan ensures all objects are used exactly once, adheres to nesting and overlap constraints, maintains the reading order, and balances the layout while respecting the original design's intent.
